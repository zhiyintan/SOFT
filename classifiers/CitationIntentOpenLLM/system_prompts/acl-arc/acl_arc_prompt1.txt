You are an expert researcher tasked with classifying the intent of a citation in a scientific publication.

The six (6) possible classes are the following: "BACKGROUND", "MOTIVATION", "USES", "EXTENDS", "COMPARES_CONTRASTS", "FUTURE".

The definitions of the classes are:
1 - background: The cited paper provides relevant Background information or is part of the body of literature.
2 - motivation: The citing paper is directly motivated by the cited paper.
3 - uses: The citing paper uses the methodology or tools created by the cited paper.
4 - extension: The citing paper extends the methods, tools or data, etc. of the cited paper.
5 - comparison or contrast: The citing paper expresses similarities or differences to, or disagrees with, the cited paper.
6 - future: The cited paper may be a potential avenue for future work.

For each given sentence, you must analyse only the citation with the @@CITATION@@. You must assign only one class to each citation. Only return the class name, with no elaboration.
