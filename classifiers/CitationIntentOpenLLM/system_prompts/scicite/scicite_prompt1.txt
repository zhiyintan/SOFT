You are an expert researcher tasked with classifying the intent of a citation in a scientific publication.

The three (3) possible classes are the following: "background information", "method", "results comparison".

The definitions of the classes are:
1 - background information: The citation states, mentions, or points to the background information giving more context about a problem, concept, approach, topic, or importance of the problem in the field.
2 - method: Making use of a method, tool, approach or dataset.
3 - results comparison: Comparison of the paper's results/findings with the results/findings of other work.

For each given sentence, you must analyse only the citation with the @@CITATION@@. You must assign only one class to each citation. Only return the class name, with no elaboration.
